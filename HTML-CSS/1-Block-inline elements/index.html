Block level element (Majlele porr : malach aakh pahijel)
    1. Block-level elements in HTML are those elements that typically start on a new line and
    2. occupy the full width available to them. 
    3. They create "blocks" of content within the parent's document layout.
    4. Block-level elements occupy the entire width of their container

        Ex(div,p,h1, ul, table, header)

Inline-level Elements (garib porrr : sagal nko fkt mla pahijel tevdh gheto)
    1. Inline-level elements do not start on a new line. 
    2. They only take up as much width as necessary, and they can only contain data and other inline elements. 
    3. They do not break the flow of content.

        Ex. span, a, img br ,label, input

Heading elements <h1> - <h6>
    1. The <h1> to <h6> HTML elements represent six levels of section headings. 
    2. <h1> is the highest section level and <h6> is the lowest.
    3. Do not use heading elements to resize text. Instead, use the CSS font-size property.
    4. While using multiple <h1> elements on one page is allowed by the HTML standard (as long as they are not nested), this is not considered a best practice. 
    5. A page should generally have a single <h1> element that describes the content of the page (similar to the document's <title> element).
    6. Its is block level element

<p>: The Paragraph element
    1. The <p> HTML element represents a paragraph. 
    2. Paragraphs are block-level elements

<a>: The Anchor element
    1. The <a> HTML element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.
    Ex. <a href="https://example.com">Website</a>
    
    2. Href (Hypertext Reference)
        The URL that the hyperlink points to. Links are not restricted to HTTP-based URLs â€” they can use any URL scheme supported by browsers:
    3. Target
        Where to display the linked URL
        _self: The current browsing context. (Default)
        _blank: Usually a new tab, but users can configure browsers to open a new window instead.

    
<img>: The Image Embed element
    1. The <img> HTML element embeds an image into the document.
    2. The src attribute is required, and contains the path to the image you want to embed.
    3. The alt attribute holds a textual replacement for the image (alternative text)
    4. lt text is also displayed on the page if the image can't be loaded for some reason: for example, network errors, content blocking
